A classical, search based chess engine.

As a hobby project and something that I was always fascinated with, I am developing a chess engine that can play a decent game of 
chess. It is still in the development phase and I hope that within the next couple of months, I can release a functional version of 
this work.

Do note that this will just be the game engine. You will still require a GUI and an interface to use it. 'Arena' is a free software
that can do this for you.
